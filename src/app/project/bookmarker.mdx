# Introduction

Save once, access everywhere.

Whether it is chrome, edge, firefox, opera or any of the million web browsers available, one essential part is bookmarking. Unfortunately, when you save bookmark on one browser, it is not accessible on other browsers or devices. Worst still, you may lose all this bookmarks if you lose your device.

Bookmarker is meant to be available across multiple browsers and even a website to view your bookmarks
